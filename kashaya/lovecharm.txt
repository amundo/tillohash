A Love Charm.

You should find quail droppings. Having done so,
you should take some sticky redwood pitch. Then you
should mix them together with a stick. Then you should
wrap it up well in something. Having done that you should
envelop it in a little handkerchief of yours. You should
keep it that way. Now, having found a man that you like,
you should first try without that [charm]. However, if 
that person does not like you, you should then try with
your charm. You should hold a conversation with him.
Keep on talking with him. In order to make him fall in 
love with you, you should always go around holding that
handkerchief in your hand. Take that handkerchief along
with you. You should put your arm around him with that.
If you do so, that person will fall in love with you just
as if it were nothing, even though you are ugly.
