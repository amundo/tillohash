[Tony Tillohash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Tillohash) was a Paiute Indian who worked with Edward Sapir to describe the Southern Paiute language. 

Sapir said of him: 

> "Despite his five years' absence from home, Tony's musical memory was quite remarkable. Besides the myth-songs [i.e., the myth recitatives] spoken of here, over two hundred other songs of various kinds (three or four varieties of "cry" or mourning songs, bear-dance songs, round-dance songs, ghost-dance songs, medicine songs, gambling songs, scalp songs, and others less easy to classify) were obtained from him."

Superhero linguists like Sapir and Tillohash had magnificent memories, but the rest of us tend to forget things. I'm writing this tool to act as a sort of "offboard linguistic memory" for people carrying out study of a language.  

As this is the goal I figured Tillohash would be a good name for the project. (Plus his name happens to contain "hash", which is kind of pleasing in a geeky sort of way!)
