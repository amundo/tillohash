<p>This is an introduction to linguistic glossing, and to a new tool for doing glossing on the web.</p>
<p>Linguists usually gloss the language they're studying, like this: </p>

<h3>"Old School" Glossing </h3> 
<p>In the early days of linguistics, glosses looked like this:</p>
<p><img src=images/sapir-takelma-house.png title="Indonesian sample"/></p>

<p>These glosses end up in a sort of quasi-English&mdash;it reads a bit like post-modern prose, or something:</p>

<blockquote>People house they make it. Post they set it down, and here again they set it down, yonder again they set it down, in four places they set it down, in four places they set them down. Then also they place (beams) across on top thereof in four places, and on top thereof just once they lace (beam) across. Then and just house its wall they make it; then and on top thereof they put them house boards. Sugar-pine those boards they make them.</blockquote>

<p>This syntax is twisty from an English perspective, to be sure. But even from this literal and rather weird translation, you can get some feel for "where things go" in Talkema. For instance, there is clearly a similarity in structure between <em>People house they make it</em> and <em>Sugar-pine those boards they make them.</em> We can already make a guess about where relative clauses come with respect to the noun they're describing.</p>

<p>Sometimes you still see that sort of glossing, especially if you happen to be dealing with a language that doesn't have a ton of morphology. Here's a much more recent example in Indonesian:</p> 

<p><img src=images/indonesian.png title="Indonesian sample"/></p>

<p>But more often than not, nowadays linguists use what are called [cite here] "grammatical category labels"&mdash;in the Lezgian example below, we get things like OBL and GEN and FUT and NEG.</p> 
<p><img src=images/lezgian.png title="Lezgian sample"/></p>

<p>Such labels have the advantage of being precise, but the disadvantage of not being self-explanatory. Does OBL stand for "Oblique"? Does GEN stand for "Genitive"? Probably, on both counts&mdash;but you're going to have to double check before you can read that gloss with any understanding.</p> 

<p>It's worth noting that the Takelma example required reams of footnotes&mdash;almost every word has one, and in many cases they boil down to the sort of information contained in modern grammatical category labels. Case in point, the form <em>k!emèi
